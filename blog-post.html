      <p>
    It all started during my final year of computer science. While most of my peers were diving into backend development and data structures, I found myself constantly drawn to the visuals - the way interfaces looked, how buttons were placed, and how the user felt navigating a site.
  </p>

    “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.” — Steve Jobs
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    I didn’t have a mentor, fancy courses, or even a design background. What I had was curiosity and a deep desire to make technology more human. I began learning UI/UX through free resources like YouTube, Mimo, and articles on Medium. I downloaded Figma and started redesigning apps I already used, just for fun.
  </p>

  <p>
    The more I designed, the more I realized how vital empathy is in this field. I wasn’t just designing buttons, I was designing solutions. From wireframes to user research, every step felt meaningful. One of my first solo projects was a smart garden app dashboard. It helped me understand how to turn messy data into something usable and beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fast forward to today, I’ve completed internships where I worked as both a UI/UX designer and a front-end developer. I’ve learned that great design is about simplicity, clarity, and listening to users. My journey is still ongoing, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited for what’s next.
